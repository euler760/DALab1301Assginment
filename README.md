# DALab1301Assginment 
**Brief_Introduction**<br>
My name is S. Ritish Karthik, AM25B029. I'm from Chennai, Tamil Nadu and I'm interested in coding and love playing football, basketball and practicing for athletics.<br>
The thing I love the most about GitHub is how it allows us to interactively code, develop and also collaborate.<br>
The assignment problem in Python that I enjoyed the most was the question that asked us to compare the performance of linear search and binary search and plotting it on a graph by using time, numpy and matplotlib.
